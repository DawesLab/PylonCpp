Code for the PyLoN CCD via the PICam API from Princeton Instruments.

For now, this is just getting a feel for the camera.

At this point, the Makefile only compiles the configure utility.

To run these (we use Fedora 19) you need to install the PIcam tools from: ftp://ftp.piacton.com/Public/Software/Official/PICam/

Download Picam_SDK_v2.4.1.run
chmod +x Picam_SDK_v2.4.1.run
sudo Picam_SDK_v2.4.1.run

as root:
source /opt/PrincetonInstruments/picam/set_picam_env

at this point, you should be able to compile and run these tools (as root). I'll post updates if I can get this to work as a non-superuser.
